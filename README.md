# :yo_yo: Compute Over Data Playground

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/davidgasquez/cod-playground)

Sandbox environment to play around Compute Over Data (COD) technologies.

## :rocket: Getting Started

You can easily get started with GitHub Codespaces¹ or Visual Studio Code Development Containers. Alternatively, you can also run the playground with Docker (`make dev`).

You can now start running computation over data using Bacalhau, Kamu, Iroh and other tools!

¹ Click on the green "Code" button and select "Open with Codespaces".

## :magic_wand: Examples

- Running a SQL query over a Parquet File stored in IPFS: `bacalhau create bacalhau/duckdb.yaml --download`.
